## Features

- Command-Line Interaction for Enhanced Engagement: "Epic War: The Card Game" is designed to bring the classic card game War into the digital era, with a focus on simplicity and player engagement. Through command-line inputs, players actively participate in the game, making each round and tie event more interactive and strategic.

Gameplay: At the start of each game, the deck is evenly divided between the two players. Players then take turns drawing the top card from their decks for a head-to-head comparison. The basic rules are simple: the higher card wins the round, and the winning player takes both cards, placing them at the bottom of their deck. In the event of a tie, where both players draw cards of equal rank, the game's unique Automatic War variation comes into play.

Game Start: Players begin the game with a simple command-line input, setting the stage for a battle of wits and luck. This input simulates the anticipation of drawing the first card in a traditional card game, adding to the game's immersive experience.
Strategic Decision-Making in Ties: In the classic game of War, ties are resolved by a straightforward mechanic leading to a "war" where additional cards are drawn. "Epic War" enhances this experience by introducing a choice at the moment of a tie:
Automatic War: By opting for Automatic War, players engage in the traditional tiebreaker mechanism of War, but with an exciting twist. The game automatically initiates the war sequence, drawing cards to determine the winner. This option retains the game's fast pace and adds a layer of anticipation for the players.
Surrender Option: Alternatively, players can choose to surrender during a tie, forfeiting the round but potentially saving their stronger cards for future battles. This option introduces a significant strategic element to the game, as players must weigh the risks and rewards of continuing the war versus surrendering.
