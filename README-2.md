# Epic War: The Card Game

Objective
The primary goal of "Epic War: The Card Game" is to provide a digital rendition of the classic card game War, but with an epic twist. Essentially, War is a card game that pits two players against each other in a battle of luck and strategy, with the highest card winning each round until one player emerges victorious by collecting all the cards. "Epic War" elevates this classic experience by incorporating an additional "Automatic war" or Surrender feature that enhances strategic depth and player immersion. The game should appeal to both long-time fans of card games and newcomers looking for a quick and entertaining gaming session.

Background
The inspiration for "Epic War: The Card Game" stems from a combination of a passion for classic card games and the desire to learn and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a fun, practical project. War, with its straightforward rules but thrilling gameplay, presents the perfect canvas for experimenting with new programming concepts, and game development strategies. This project is an educational journey aimed at honing coding skills, understanding the intricacies of game design, and fostering collaboration and communication.


## Features

Command-Line Interaction for Enhanced Engagement: "Epic War: The Card Game" is designed to bring the classic card game War into the digital era. Through command-line inputs, players actively participate in the game, making each round and tie event more interactive and strategic.

Gameplay: At the start of each game, the deck is evenly divided between the two players. Players then take turns drawing the top card from their decks for a head-to-head comparison. The basic rules are simple: the higher card wins the round, and the winning player takes both cards, placing them at the bottom of their deck. In the event of a tie, where both players draw cards of equal rank, the game's unique Automatic War variation comes into play.

Game Start: Players begin the game with a simple command-line input, Automatic War or Surrender. 
Strategic Decision-Making in Ties: In the classic game of War, ties are resolved by a straightforward mechanic leading to a "war" where additional one face down card is drawn, and one face up. "Epic War" enhances this experience by introducing a choice at the moment of a tie:
Automatic War: By opting for Automatic War, players engage in the traditional tiebreaker mechanism of War, but with an exciting twist. The game now gives an option to proceed with Automatic war or Surrender.
Surrender Option: Alternatively, players can choose to surrender during a tie, forfeiting the round but potentially saving their stronger cards for future battles. This option introduces a significant strategic element to the game, as players must weigh the risks and rewards of continuing the war versus surrendering.
Winner Declaration Based on Deck Size: The ultimate winner of "Epic War: The Card Game" is declared when one player accumulates all the cards.
